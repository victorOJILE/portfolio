## Overview

 This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my skills, projects and experience.

 This project consists of:
  * An [about](https://victorojile.github.io/portfolio/#about_me) section with my personal and professional background, skills, and interests.
  
  * A portfolio section which exhibits all main [projects](https://victorojile.github.io/portfolio/#project) I have worked on, in addition to some I made for fun. This includes descriptions, screenshots, and links to live demos and source code.
  
  * My [skills](https://victorojile.github.io/portfolio/#about_me) section where I list out web technologies I am equipped with, that enables me build dynamic and responsive web applications that meet business requirements.
  
  * Also, a basic contact form section where visitors can [reach out](https://victorojile.github.io/portfolio/#contact-form) by text messages.
